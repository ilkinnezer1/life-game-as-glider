# Game of Life Simulation

C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

## Features

- Simulates Conway's Game of Life on a 16x32 toroidal grid.
- Includes a basic glider pattern at initialization.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang)
- Unix-like environment (Linux, MacOS) for `unistd.h`

## Compilation

Compile the program using the following command:

```bash
g++ -o GameOfLife main.cpp
